#ABSTRACT 
1.	Studies of drivers shaping forest communities frequently include abiotic or biotic factors, while their interactive effects remain understudied. Here, we combined data on two prominent abiotic gradients, climatic moisture deficit and wildfire probability, along with tree functional neighborhoods (i.e., trait differences of close neighbors) to assess variation in survival and growth of 56 tree species in the northwestern US.
2.	We asked two questions: 1) How does functional neighborhood dissimilarity vary with environmental gradients? and 2) How do demographic rates of tree species in the northwestern US vary with the interactive effects of environmental gradients and functional neighborhood? We expected functional neighborhoods to become more similar as environmental stress increased, due to a convergence of species towards an optimum stress tolerance strategy. We also predicted interactive effects of abiotic and biotic factors on tree demography, and high variation in species-specific responses to these interactive effects due to divergent species life history strategies. 
3.	Functional neighborhoods defined by dissimilarities in stem conductivity, litter decomposition, resprouting ability, and specific leaf area changed with climate, shifting to more diverse neighborhoods as climatic moisture deficit and wildfire probability increased. Results supported interactive effects of the functional neighborhood and climatic moisture deficit or wildfire probability on tree demography, but only when species commonality was considered. Species-specific responses were highly variable in their direction and magnitude, and often demonstrated opposing effects of climate and the functional neighborhood and climatic moisture deficit on tree demography.  
4.	Synthesis Our findings show that climate and tree neighborhood functional dissimilarity jointly impact tree demography, however, the effects are species-specific. Results of this study highlight the need to consider interactive effects of abiotic and biotic contexts and individual species responses to their environment to adequately understand tree persistence under current and future climate conditions.
